- verify gsf conversion, some tests fail on Windows but not POSIX?
- make a SummaryInformation API that does not suck (including converting
  FILETIME usage to GDateTime)
- add an API to open a query and return a pointer to the next SQL
  statement in the passed string
- add a SQL tool with readline
- add API to import from a string
- add API to write a stream field to a GIO stream or back
- split regression tests into many smaller harnesses, possibly using 
  gtester
- add tests for msiinfo

...

Missing functionality:

- generating transforms

Use GLIB 2.22?
- GInitable, GAsync
